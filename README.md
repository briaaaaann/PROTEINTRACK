🥗 ProteinTrack
Smart inventory and demand management system for ProteinFoods Restaurant

🔮 Vision
ProteinTrack aims to build a simple, reliable, and intelligent system to manage inventory, production, and sales for the ProteinFoods restaurant.
Developed in Python and PostgreSQL, it seeks to unify operational data into a centralized platform, enabling efficient decision-making and future integration with predictive analytics and Power BI dashboards.

📡 Overview
  - Currently in Stage 2: Development of the management system in Python.
  - Stage 1 completed: Integration and centralization of production, sales, and inventory data in PostgreSQL.
  - Stage 3 (upcoming): Development of a demand prediction module using machine learning to forecast product needs and reduce overstocking or shortages.
  - Predictive insights will be displayed through Power BI visual dashboards.
  - Database and backend are being developed with scalability and modularity in mind for future system extensions.

💌 Features
  - Centralized inventory, sales, and production data management.
  - Python + PostgreSQL architecture for scalability and reliability.
  - Modular structure for integration of analytics and reporting tools.
